# AI-Trivia
An AI will create Trivia questions and correct your answer
- Made with [GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/introduction/key-concepts) (an AI created by OpenAI)
- You will be using the "[text-davinci-001](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)" bot or formerly "davinci-instruct-beta-v3", but you can change it in the constant 'ENGINE' in the main.py file:
  - text-davinci-001 (faster and most expensive)
  - text-curie-001
  - text-babbage-001
  - text-ada-001
- This is an Alpha version and does not provide an API key
